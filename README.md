UNIC = _s + unsemantic + sass + â™¥

README IS TODO!! :)

UNIC is a base theme for Wordpress for developers to build upon. It is my favorite way to theme for Wordpress from scratch. I started with Automattic's underscores base theme and combined it with the Unsemantic grid system. Then I reworked the default CSS to SASS and added some of my own additional stuff.

If you find it useful, please enjoy.

#FEATURE NOTES


##Built on the Unsemantic Grid
The most flexible and logical grid system there is. 

You can read the full syntax over at http://unsemantic.com.

The theme also includes a shortcode system to include grids in post content.

`

    [grid 33] A 33% width grid [/grid]
	
	[grid 33] A 33% width grid [/grid]
	
	[grid 33] A 33% width grid [/grid]
`

Simple as that!

##Easy web font support via SASS
The main style.css is build with style.sass in the theme root folder. It includes various files from the /sass/ folder, which can be easily customized to your needs.

Here are some examples:

###Easy Variables
###SASS Gradient
###Web Fonts

##Built it responsive menu system / functions
