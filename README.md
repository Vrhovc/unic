#UNIC
##_s + unsemantic + sass + â™¥

UNIC is a base theme for Wordpress for developers to build upon. It is my favorite way to theme for Wordpress from scratch. I started with Automattic's underscores base theme and combined it with the Unsemantic grid system. Then I reworked the default CSS to SASS and added some of my own additional stuff. I use it all the time. If you do as well, please let me know, I'd love to hear your feedback.

##Features & Notes


###Built on the Unsemantic Grid
IMHO, Undemantic is the most flexible and logical grid system there is. You can read the full syntax over at http://unsemantic.com.

The theme also includes a shortcode system to include grids in post content.

`

    [grid 33] A 33% width grid [/grid]
	
	[grid 33] A 33% width grid [/grid]
	
	[grid 33] A 33% width grid [/grid]
`

Simple as that!

###Easy web font support via SASS
The main style.css is build with style.sass in the theme root folder. It includes various files from the /sass/ folder, which can be easily customized to your needs.

###Smart SASS Structure & Variables
###SASS Gradients
###Easy Web Fonts

###Built in responsive menu system / functions
Uses a simple function which works like the standard WP menu function. By default the theme shows and hides the menus via Unsemantic responsive classes.

`
	<?php wp_nav_menu_select( array( 'theme_location' => 'primary' ) ); ?>
`
